# Ars longa, vita brevis

_Ars longa, vita brevis_ quotes the first two lines of the Latin translation of an [[Aphorism]] by [[Hippocrates]]:

> _Vīta brevis,_
_ars longa,_
_occāsiō praeceps,_
_experīmentum perīculōsum,_
_iūdicium difficile._
>
> —Hippocrates

Achieving mastery in a craft (in his case, Medicine) takes long, and since life is too short we shouldn't waste our time.
