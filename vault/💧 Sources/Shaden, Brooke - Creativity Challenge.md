# Creativity Challenge
**reconnect to the reason why you are an artist, and make something that ignites your soul.**

Voice refers to the way your art looks / sounds / feels to other people. Voice can be synonymous with style, but it goes beyond visuals. It can also be equated with brand, but again, goes beyond. It is the way that everything you offer resonates with others.

Message is the idea behind what you do. It may point to theme, emotion, or story...or all three! No matter what, message is elemental to how we create and how we are understood. Message asks: What are you trying to say with your art?

Value is defined as your importance, or what you bring to the table that can benefit you and others. Your worth is determined by your value. What are your strengths? What do you offer that someone else may not?

Before you ever begin to create art, try to ensure that those three words are definable in relation to yourself, your art, and your business if applicable.

Anyone can develop style. But the more you do so with the intention of honing that style with unique voice, consistent messaging, and intrinsic value, the more you will create deeper art that really resonates.

# Voice
Why me? Why now? Why this?
Who are you right now?
Who do you want to be in the future?
What changes should you make?

Challenge your imposter syndrome:
- *If something is important to somebody, it is important.*
- *Nobody cares about what I do as much as I do*

## Elevator pitch
### Who are you right now?
introduction.
what details you can tell about yourself.
what you do and what your roles are
i would describe myself as
### Who do you want to be?
How/what will you change?
