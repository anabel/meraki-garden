# The subtle art of not giving a fuck

## The value of suffering
Sometimes life sucks and the healthiest thing you can do is to admit it.
Constant positivity is a form of avoidance, not a balanced solution to life problems.
If you choose the right values and metrics, problems should invigorate and motivate you.
### Tricks to negative emotions:
1. Express them in a socially acceptable and healthy matter.
2. Express them in a way that align with your values.

::Problems add a sense of meaning and importance to our life.::
## Self awareness
1. Understanding your own emotions.
2. Ability to tell why we feel those emotions. /Once we undertand the root cause of the emotion that overwhelm us we can work to change it./
3. Personal values. Why do i consider this to be a success or a failure. How I am choosing this to measure myself and the people around me.
Our values determine the nature of our problems. The nature of our problems determine the quality of our life.

Values underlay everything we are or do.

Our original analisis when we face problems tends to /avoid responsability/ about the problem itself rather than /accurately identifying it/. That fact occurs because  we are looking for highs, not for real happiness.

Problems may be inevitable, but the meaning of each problem is not. We get to control our problems based on the way we choose to think about them. The standard by which we choose to measure them.

::If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change your value and how you measure failure and success.::
### Shitty values:
- Pleasure
- Material success
- Being right
- Staying positive

These things come naturally (are a side effect) when we set good values and metrics. Focusing on them only makes you feel empty.
### Good values:
- Inmediate, controlable
- Reflects reality
- Internally achievable

Examples: Honesty, Creativity, Humility, Innovation,  Vulnerability

1. Responsibility for everything
2. Doubts in your own believe
3. Failure (discover your faults)
4. Rejection(sayong no accepting no)
5. Mortality
# You are always choosing
We are responsible for everything that happens in our life, even what we cannot control; we can always control how we interpret what happens to us as well as how do we respond.

We are always responsible for our experiences, it is imposible not to be. We are always having an acting role in what occurs to and within us using oir values and our metrics that tells is whther is a success or a failure.

Responsibility vs Fault

Both things are not the same.

::With great responsability comes great power::
## You are always wrong
You work to be less wrong than the day before, and so on. You work towards approaching truth and perfection, without ever reaching them.

Improving becomes cientific this way:

- Your values are an hipothesis.
- Your actions are the experiments.
- Our emotions and thinking patterns are the output data.

Instead of looking how we are right, we should look for how we are wrong, because we are. We should bebaleays in doubt of our believes.

Tough, we asume that what we think is true so we dont bother to change. Certainty is the enemy of growth.
