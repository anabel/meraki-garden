‘There is an inseparable bond between man and nature. For man, there cannot be an existence removed from nature. However, because of his thoughtless actions, the equilibrium in nature is getting disturbed; the pulse of human life is becoming erratic, too. Air and water have become polluted. Rivers are drying up. Seasons arrive unseasonably. New diseases are spreading. If things continue this way, the human race is in for a monumental catastrophe.’ (Immortal Bliss, Issue 3, 2011 and amma.org)
