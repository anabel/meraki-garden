To cook any type of pasta perfectly in the Instant Pot (note: you do NOT need to do this math yourself - just wanted to show you how I did it):

1.  Find the recommended cook time on any box / bag of pasta. 
2.  Take the lowest, even number in the range. (If only one time is given and it’s odd, round down. So 7 minutes becomes 6.)
3.  Divide in half.
4.  Subtract two minutes.
5.  Pressure cook on high.
6.  Use 5 minute natural release and then release any remaining pressure manually.

But there’s no need to do all that math. Just use the chart below:![pasta in the instant pot](https://inquiringchef.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/pasta-instant-pot-chart-2-600x1200.png)

**0 is a real setting on the Instant Pot / pressure cooker. For small pasta shapes with a short recommended cook time, set the timer to zero minutes. The pressure cooker will fully pressurize but won’t hold for any amount of time.

## **How Much Water to Use for Instant Pot Pasta**

Use 2 cups water for every 8 oz of pasta. So…

-  8 oz Pasta + 2 cups Water (226 gr)
-   16 oz Pasta + 4 cups Water
-   24 oz Pasta + 6 cups Water

You can disregard this if you’re cooking pasta in a lot of liquid or sauce (like in a soup or ragu), but the cook times still hold true. 

## **How to Cook Pasta in the Instant Pot**

1.  Combine pasta and water (using measurement above) in the bowl of the Instant Pot. Give everything a stir so that the pasta gets a bit wet.
2.  Seal and lock the lid.
3.  Pressure cook on high. (Use the chart above to determine the cook time.)
4.  Leave the pasta on natural release for 5 minutes (do not let this sit any longer or the pasta may overcook) and then manually release any remaining pressure. 
5.  Unplug the machine or check to be sure that all heating / warming functions are off.
6.  Open the lid and give the pasta a very good stir - about 20 to 30 times. Put some muscle into it so that the pasta gets really well incorporated with the small amount of water that remains. (Note: When you start stirring the pasta, there may still be a few dry spots on the pasta where it was sticking out of the water. Don’t worry - as you stir and let the pasta steam in the next step, it will continue to absorb the small amount of liquid in the pot.)
7.  Return the lid (no need to lock it just set it on top) and leave the pasta to sit for 5-10 minutes more. (Note: This step is the most important because the pasta will continue to absorb any remaining liquid and continue to cook just a bit in the residual heat of the machine. This is the key to pasta that is cooked, but not _over-cooked._)
8.  Serve!
