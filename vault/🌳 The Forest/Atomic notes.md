[[Evergreen notes]]

# Atomic notes

This is a [[üóÉÔ∏è PKM]] concept. ==Atomic notes are notes about a **single concept or idea**==. Most notes in a [[PKM system]] should be atomic, so we facilitate both retrieval and forming relationship between them with links.

The main advantage of these notes is that when we encounter the same ideas from different sources (for instance, two authors), we can keep evolving this one single note (see [[Evergreen notes]]) instead of having duplicated information.

Even if we keep [[Literature notes]] for the books, courses, etc. we want to annotate, we should eventually extract the bits of information that are relevant to us in [[Evergreen notes]] (which should be atomic).

I first learned of this concept when researching about [[Zettlekasten]], since it's one of its pillars.
