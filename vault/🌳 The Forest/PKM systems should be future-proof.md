[[🗃️ PKM]]

# PKM systems should be future-proof

Since a [[Personal Knowledge Base]] grows and grains value over time [[Future-proof|Future-proofing]] it ==is vital to ensure this value doesn't disappear and that the PKB is usable== for decades (ideally, for one's lifespan).

Ways of achieving this:

- Using **plain text files**, which are easily readable.
- **Backing up** on the cloud so there is no data loss.
- Maintaining **independence** from the actual tool or app used.
    - Use of standard features and formats, like Markdown, WikiLinks, etc.
    - Favoring [[Open-source software]] whenever posible.
