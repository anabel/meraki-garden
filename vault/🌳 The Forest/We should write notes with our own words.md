[[Evergreen notes]]

# We should write notes with our own words

In a [[PKM system]], we should aim to write notes with our own words, instead of just transcribing what someone else said or wrote.

- It forces us to _understand_ the concept we are working with.
- It's away of curating and being mindful of what we feed our [[Digital garden]].
- We should write our notes for ourselves, not someone else.
